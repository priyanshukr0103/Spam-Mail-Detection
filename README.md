# Spam-Mail-Detection
This project builds a Spam Mail Detection system using NLP and Machine Learning. It classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam) using the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) algorithm. The model is trained with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to enhance feature extraction and improve classification accuracy..



## **Key Features**

1.) Data Preprocessing: Managing missing data and encoding categorical labels.

2.) Feature Extraction: Transforming text into numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer.

3.) Model Training: Implementing Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) for email classification.

4.) Performance Analysis: Evaluating accuracy, generating classification reports, and using a confusion matrix.

5.) Hyperparameter Optimization: Enhancing model performance with GridSearchCV.

6.) Email Classification: Predicting whether user-input emails are spam or legitimate.

## **Technologies Used**  

- **Python** ‚Äì Core programming language for implementation.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** ‚Äì Efficient data handling and manipulation.  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì Machine learning models, performance metrics, and feature extraction.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì Data visualization for insights and analysis.

## **Dataset**
This project utilizes a labeled email dataset categorized into two classes:

- Ham (1): Genuine, non-spam emails
- Spam (0): Unwanted or junk emails

### **Installation & Setup**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-mail-detection.git  
cd spam-mail-detection
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Dataset

Place mail_data.csv in the working directory.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script
```
python spam_detection.py
```

### **Code Overview**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Handle missing values.
Convert labels (spam, ham) into binary format (1 = Ham, 0 = Spam).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction
Transform email text into numerical form using TfidfVectorizer.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Train a Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) model on extracted features.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Evaluation
Measure accuracy on training and test sets.
Generate a classification report and confusion matrix.
Optimize model performance using GridSearchCV.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Spam Mail Prediction
The model takes an email input and classifies it as spam or ham.

üîπ Example:

input_email = ["Congratulations! You have won a lottery. Call now to claim!"]  
input_features = feature_extraction.transform(input_email)  
prediction = model.predict(input_features)  
print("Spam mail" if prediction[0] == 0 else "Ham mail")
