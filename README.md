# Spam-Mail-Detection
This project builds a Spam Mail Detection system using NLP and Machine Learning. It classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam) using the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) algorithm. The model is trained with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to enhance feature extraction and improve classification accuracy.
